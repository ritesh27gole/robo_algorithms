# Algorithms in Robotics

General software problems in robotics solved using fundamental algorithms

1. Rapidly exploring Random Trees (RRT) Algorithm: 
RRT is one of most popular algorithms used for path planning for autonomous vehicles, mobile robots as well as robotic manipulators

Open the "RRT" Folder to find "rrt.py" script and "occupancyGrid.npy" array which resembles a map of room consisting of obstacles
